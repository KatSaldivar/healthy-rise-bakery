            <p class ="about-text">Mary is a Registered Dietitian and member of Bread Bakers Guild of America who thinks food can be satisfying,
             and healthy without being supersized or loaded with calories and fat. She bakes using organic ingredients 
             mostly from local sources. Our bakers start work before the sun rises each day to ensure that every batch 
             is as fresh as possible before it gets to you. We're dedicated to kickstarting your morning with warm muffins,
              rolls and bread and gluten free desserts. We buy local and grind our own flour for every batch. We love  supplying
               local coffee shops/cafes and working with businesses to deliver fresh bread, rolls, muffins and gluten free muffins 
               and cookies to your employees for greater employee engagement.
